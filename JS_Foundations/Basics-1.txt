console.log() function to print to console.

if you add external JS file in <head> tag then it will be executed first before content of <body>, so add it at end of <body> tag.

JS file has .js extension.

3 keywords to declare variables - let, var , const
For the sake of better readability, please use a single line for declaration per variable.
e.g.
let a=10;
let msg = "hello";
let money =100;

or

let a=10,
    msg = "hello",
    money = 100;

Both does same thing.

There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:
1)The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
2)The first character must not be a digit.

const variables are written in two ways 
1) All capital - when value is known before execution of code. e.g. const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
2) Camel Case - when value will be fixed after calculated and assigned. e.g. const pageLoadTime = /* this will be calculated and assigned */

USE let because var behaves differently somewhere.
variable declaration with var has issue with scope and redeclaration.

e.g. redeclaration issue

var x =10;

{
    var x =2;
}

console.log(x); // x = 2 here


e.g. scope issue

{
    var x = 5;
}

console.log(x); // available outside of declaration scope.
