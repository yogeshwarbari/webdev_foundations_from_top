1)  Using the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your sites: 
    i)  how they are ranked in search engines; 
    ii) and how accessible they are to users who rely on assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.

2)  MDN Docs link for vast list of HTML tags and their documentation.
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

3)  We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our websites index.html. 
    This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites - and not having one will cause big problems.

4)  The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document.
    The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.

5)  If we didn’t include a title element, the webpage’s title would default to its file name.

6)  Always have the meta tag in the head element for the charset encoding of the webpage: <meta charset="utf-8">.
    Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters 
    from different languages correctly in the browser.

7)  HTML code validator: https://validator.w3.org/

8)  Use <strong> and <em> tags instead of <b> and <i> tags respectively because they supports accessiblity for those who need screen readers.
