1.  Basic Syntax:
    selector {
        property : value;
    }

2. Universal selector - *
    * {
        color : red;
    }

3. We can add multiple classes, separated by space so use hyphen not spaces for multi-word class name.
    class = "hello-world  goodbye"

4.  id vs class attribute --> id should be used where specificity is needed.
        i. an element can only have one ID but multiple classes.
        ii. An ID cannot be repeated on a single page but classes can be reused.
        iii. ID attribute should not contain any whitespace at all but allowed in class attribute.

5.  Grouping: Two selectors an be used by separating with comma.
    h1,h3 {
        color: red;
    }

6. Selector chaining works for all types of selector except element selector.
    .classmain.subclass {
        color: red;
    }
    div#id1 {
color: red;
    }

    If we try with elements. 
    divp {

    }
    This will try to look for tag <divp> so won't work.

7. There are 4 Combinators.
    i. Descendent Combinator: Parent-child relationship
    <div class="parent>
        <div class="child"></div>
    </div>

    .parent .child {
        color: red;
    }
    This will select .child class having parent with .parent class.

8.  Precedence order:
    id selector > class selector > type(tag) selector
    During tie : - more number of selector > less number of selector

9.  Inheritance : The child inherites the parent properties as well.
    But if the child is specifically targeted then by specificity rule the child properties gets applied.

10. Rule Order : After all rules of specificity & inheritance if still there is a tie-breaker, the last one defined wins/ overwrites.

11. Adding Styles : 3 ways
        i. External CSS:
            In <head>, using <style rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

        ii. Internal CSS : using <style> tag inside <<head> tag.
            <head>
                <style>
                h1 {
                    color: green;
                }

                div {
                    color : yellow;
                }
                </style>
            </head>
        iii. Inline CSS :
            <div style="color: red; background-color: yellow;">...</div>
